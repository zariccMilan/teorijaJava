What is Java?
Java is a popular programming language that is widely used for developing applications, especially in client-server web applications. It was created by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995. 
Java is an object-oriented language that runs on a virtual machine called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. An interface is a collection of abstract methods that cannot have any implementation. In Java, 
a class can extend only one abstract class, but can implement multiple interfaces.

What is the difference between a class and an object?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects that define the attributes and behaviors of the objects. An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity and can be manipulated by invoking its methods.

What is a constructor in Java?
A constructor is a special method in Java that is used to initialize objects. It is called automatically when an object is created and is used to set initial values for the object's attributes.

What are the access modifiers in Java?
Access modifiers are keywords that determine the accessibility of a class, method, or variable in Java. The four access modifiers in Java are public, private, protected, and default.

What is the difference between the "==" operator and the "equals()" method?
The "==" operator compares the memory addresses of two objects to determine if they are the same object. The "equals()" method compares the values of two objects to determine if they are equal.

What is the difference between a static and a non-static method?
A static method belongs to the class and can be called without creating an object of the class. A non-static method belongs to an object of the class and can only be called after creating an object of the class.

What is the difference between a stack and a queue?
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed. A queue is a data structure that 
follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first element to be removed.

What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors depending on the context in which it is used. In Java, polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

What is inheritance in Java?
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows a subclass to inherit the properties and behaviors of its parent class. This helps to promote code reuse and reduce redundancy in the code.

What is encapsulation in Java?
Encapsulation is a mechanism in Java that allows data to be hidden from other classes and accessed only through methods defined in the class. This helps to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access to data.

What is the difference between an ArrayList and a LinkedList?
An ArrayList is a dynamic array that allows elements to be added or removed from any position in the array. A LinkedList is a linked list that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends of the list.

What is the difference between a HashMap and a TreeMap?
A HashMap is an unordered collection of key-value pairs that allows null keys and values. A TreeMap is a sorted map that orders its entries based on the keys.

What is a singleton class?
A singleton class is a class that can have only one instance in the entire system. It is often used to provide a global point of access to a resource.

What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
In Java, exceptions are divided into two categories: checked and unchecked. Checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile-time. This means that the programmer must handle these exceptions 
by either catching them or declaring them in the method signature. Examples of checked exceptions include IOException, SQLException, and ClassNotFoundException.

Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, are the exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. This means that the programmer is not required to handle these exceptions. 
Unchecked exceptions are typically caused by programming errors such as null pointer exceptions, array index out of bounds exceptions, and class cast exceptions. 
Examples of unchecked exceptions include RuntimeException, NullPointerException, and IndexOutOfBoundsException.

What is the difference between a StringBuilder and a StringBuffer?
StringBuilder and StringBuffer are both classes that represent mutable sequences of characters. The main difference is that StringBuffer is thread-safe, meaning it is synchronized and can be used by multiple threads, 
while StringBuilder is not thread-safe.

What is the difference between a synchronized and an unsynchronized method?
A synchronized method can only be accessed by one thread at a time, preventing multiple threads from accessing the method simultaneously, while an unsynchronized method can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

What is a thread in Java?
A thread is the smallest unit of processing in a program, and represents a separate flow of execution within the program. Multiple threads can run concurrently within a program.

What is a deadlock in Java?
A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a situation where none of the threads can proceed.

What is a race condition in Java?
A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results. The outcome of the program depends on the order and timing of the threads' access to the shared data.

What is a JVM?
A JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that provides the runtime environment in which Java programs execute. The JVM translates compiled Java bytecode into machine-specific instructions 
that can be executed by the computer.

What is a JIT compiler?
A JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler is a type of compiler that compiles code at runtime, as opposed to ahead-of-time compilation. In Java, the JVM uses a JIT compiler to compile bytecode into machine-specific 
instructions at runtime, improving the performance of the program.

What is garbage collection in Java?
Garbage collection is the process by which the JVM automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used by the program.

What is a finalize() method?
The finalize() method is a method provided by the Object class in Java that is called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed. It can be used to perform cleanup operations on the object before it is destroyed.

What is the difference between a private and a protected method?
A private method can only be accessed within the class in which it is defined, while a protected method can be accessed by subclasses of the class in which it is defined.

What is a package in Java?
A package is a namespace that contains a group of related classes and interfaces. Packages provide a way to organize and manage large Java programs.

What is an interface in Java?
An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods that define a set of behaviors. Classes can implement an interface to provide concrete implementations of the abstract methods.

What is the purpose of the "finally" block in Java?
The finally block is used in try-catch-finally statements to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

What is a lambda expression in Java?
A lambda expression is a short block of code that represents a function. It can be used to create anonymous functions that can be passed as arguments to other functions.

What is a stream in Java 8?
A stream in Java 8 is a sequence of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. Streams provide a way to perform operations on collections of data in a functional style.

What is the difference between a method reference and a lambda expression?
A method reference is a shorthand notation for a lambda expression that refers to an existing method. Lambda expressions can be used to create new functions, while method references are used to refer to existing functions.

What is a functional interface in Java?
A functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method. It is used to provide a single method interface to implement with a lambda expression or a method reference. 
Java 8 introduced functional interfaces to support the new lambda expressions feature.

What is the purpose of the "super" keyword in Java?
The "super" keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class. It is used to access methods, variables, and constructors of the parent class.

What is a default method in Java 8?
A default method is a method in an interface that has a default implementation. It provides a way to add new methods to an interface without breaking the existing implementations. 
Default methods are introduced in Java 8 to support the new lambda expressions feature.

What is the difference between a final, finally, and finalize keyword in Java?
"final" is a keyword used to indicate that a variable or method cannot be changed. "finally" is a keyword used in a try-catch block to execute a block of code regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. 
"finalize" is a method in Java that is called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed to perform final cleanup operations.

What is the purpose of the "volatile" keyword in Java?
The "volatile" keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by multiple threads. It ensures that the value of the variable is always read from the main memory and not from the thread's cache, 
which may have stale data.

What is the purpose of the "transient" keyword in Java?
The "transient" keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized. It is useful when a variable's value does not need to be persisted when an object is serialized.

What is the purpose of the "static" keyword in Java?
The "static" keyword in Java is used to indicate that a method or variable belongs to the class, rather than an instance of the class. Static methods and variables can be accessed without creating an object of the class.

What is the purpose of the "abstract" keyword in Java?
The "abstract" keyword in Java is used to indicate that a class or method is abstract, i.e., it has no implementation. Abstract classes and methods can only be used as a blueprint for other classes to extend or implement.

What is the purpose of the "strictfp" keyword in Java?
The "strictfp" keyword in Java is used to indicate that a class or method should follow strict floating-point precision rules specified by the IEEE 754 standard. It ensures that floating-point calculations 
produce the same results on all platforms.

What is the purpose of the "this" keyword in Java?
The "this" keyword in Java is used to refer to the current object. It is used to distinguish between the instance variables and local variables with the same name.

What is a generic class in Java?
A generic class in Java is a class that can work with different types of objects. It is defined using a type parameter, which is replaced by the actual type at the time of object creation.

What is the difference between a shallow and a deep copy in Java?
A shallow copy creates a new object that points to the same memory location as the original object. A deep copy creates a new object and copies all the data from the original object to the new object.

What is a reflection in Java?
Reflection is a feature in Java that allows you to examine or modify the behavior of a class or an object at runtime, even if the class or object was not known at compile time. 
This enables you to inspect and manipulate objects dynamically, such as retrieving information about their fields, methods, and constructors, and invoking methods on them.

What is the purpose of the "assert" keyword in Java?
The "assert" keyword in Java is used for debugging and testing purposes. It allows you to test assumptions about your program's behavior at runtime, and throw an error if the assertion is false. 
This helps to catch bugs and logic errors in the code during development and testing.

What is the difference between a private and a protected variable?
In Java, a private variable can only be accessed within the class in which it is declared. It is not accessible from any other class, including subclasses. On the other hand, a protected variable can be accessed 
within the class in which it is declared, as well as by any subclasses of that class.

What is a JavaBean?
A JavaBean is a class in Java that follows a set of conventions to define a reusable software component. It is a simple, serializable, and reusable component that can be easily integrated into various applications. 
A JavaBean should have a no-argument constructor, private instance variables with public getter and setter methods, and should implement the Serializable interface.

What is the difference between a stack and a heap?
In Java, a stack and a heap are two different types of memory used for storing data. A stack is a region of memory used for storing temporary variables and method calls. It is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, 
meaning that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. On the other hand, a heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. It is a more flexible data structure, 
where objects are stored and removed in an unpredictable order.

What is the purpose of the "throws" keyword in Java?
The "throws" keyword in Java is used to declare that a method may throw an exception. It is part of the method signature, and informs the caller of the method that they must handle any exceptions 
that might be thrown by the method. This helps to ensure that any potential exceptions are caught and handled appropriately, improving the overall robustness and reliability of the program.

What is the purpose of the "try-with-resources" statement in Java?
The "try-with-resources" statement in Java is used for automatically closing resources, such as streams, files, and sockets, that are opened during the execution of a program. It eliminates the need for 
explicit resource management code, and helps to prevent resource leaks and errors. The statement takes one or more resources as its arguments, and the resources are automatically closed at the end of the block, 
regardless of whether an exception occurs.
